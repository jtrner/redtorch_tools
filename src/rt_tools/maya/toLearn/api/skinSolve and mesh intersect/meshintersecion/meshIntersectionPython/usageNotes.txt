# --------- ESSENTIAL NOTES  -------------- #
#
# YOU WILL NEED the numpy library installed on your machine.

#
#
#
# ---------- USAGE ------------------------ # 
#
# --  For intersections between objects: -- # 
# 
# 1. Make sure TriangleTriangleIntersection.py and RayTriangleIntersection.py are 
#    in your scripts directory. 
#
# 2. Select two meshes. ( Make sure transforms are frozen! )
#
# 3. Execute the following commands from your script editor: 
#
#    import TriangleTriangleIntersection as tti
#    tti.mollerIntersect()
#
#
#
# -- For self intersections: -------------- # 
#
# 1. Make sure TriangleTriangleIntersection.py and RayTriangleIntersection.py are 
#    in your scripts directory. 
# 
# 2. Select a mesh ( Make sure transforms are frozen )
#
# 3. Execute the following commands from your script editor: 
#    
#    import TriangleTriangleIntersection as tti
#    tti.mollerSelfIntersect()
