Can you check out the "first time setup" 
it'll help populate the Git configs
sure
Will check that right now, thank you
Then there's the SSH keys
   http://pipedocs.icon.local:8000/resources/tutorial/pipeline_development/#generate-ssh-key   
Some of that page has fallen out of date and I haven't taken the time yet to update it
So, skip the "Set up your development environment repositories"
oh... actually - I think I did update it now that I'm looking at it
the info on DEV_TOOLS should help as well - though that's updated and will no longer ask you which pipeline you want to source, it is instead just a straight >> Dev TaskTool shortcut

One of my team has compiled a document going over Git Flow:

And this is a really good resource as well:
